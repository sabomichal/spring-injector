# spring-injector
A fast alternative to the Spring @Configurable magic. Based on the Apache Wicket's Spring Injector. 

Do you need to inject spring beans into non managed objects, e.g. domain objects? Are you tired of slow aspectj compilation or load-time weaving? Then spring-injector is the solution.

See the test classes for an example.
